Task 10. Multimodal Search with Embeddings and Vector Search
In this final section, you implement multimodal search directly within BigQuery. This allows for intuitive searches, like finding houses based on a text description or finding homes that look similar to a sample picture.

The process works by first converting each house image into a numerical representation called an embedding. An embedding captures the semantic meaning of an image, allowing you to find similar items by comparing their numerical vectors.

You'll use the multimodalembedding model to generate these vectors for all your listings. After creating a vector index to accelerate lookups, you then perform two types of similarity search: text-to-image (finding houses that match a description) and image-to-image (finding houses that look like a sample image).
