Task 3. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
In this section, you run through the first important step in any data science project: preparing your data. You start by creating a BigQuery dataset to organize your work and then load the raw real estate / housing data from a CSV file in Cloud Storage into a new table.

Then, you'll transform this raw data into a cleaned, feature-engineered table. This involves filtering the listings, creating a new property_age feature, and preparing the image data for multimodal analysis.
