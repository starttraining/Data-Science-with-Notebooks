Task 8. Generate Cluster Descriptions with Gemini Models
While numerical centroids and charts are powerful, generative AI allows you to go a step further and create rich, qualitative personas for each housing segment. This helps you understand not just what the clusters are, but who they represent.

In this section, you first aggregate the average statistics for each cluster, like price and square footage. Then, you pass this data into a prompt for the Gemini model. You instruct the model to act as a real estate professional and generate a detailed summary, including key characteristics and a target buyer for each segment. The result is a set of clear, human-readable descriptions that make the clusters immediately understandable and actionable for a marketing team.

Feel free to alter the prompt as you see fit and experiment with the results!
