Task 9. Automate Modeling with the Data Science Agent
Now, you'll explore a powerful, alternative workflow. Instead of writing code manually, you will use the integrated Data Science Agent to automatically generate a complete clustering model workflow from a single, natural language prompt.

Follow these steps to generate and run the model using the agent:

In the BigQuery Studio pane, click the dropdown arrow button, hover over Notebook, and then select Empty Notebook. This ensures the agent's code doesn't interfere with your original lab notebook.
Open new notebook

The Data Science Agent chat interface opens at the bottom of the notebook. Click the Move to panel button to pin the chat to the right side.
Open new notebook

Begin to type @listing_multimodal in the chat pane and Click the table. This explicitly sets the listings_multmodal table as context.
Add table context to agent

Copy the prompt below and enter it into the Agent Chat box. Afterward, Click Send to submit the prompt to the Agent.

Use the selected table to generate a k-means clustering model with 3 clusters for housing listings. Then, help me understand the characteristics of each cluster so I can market to them as a real estate professional. Use Python.
Copied!
Give Agent prompt and submit

The agent will think and formulate a plan. If you are okay with this plan, click Accept & Run. The Agent will generate Python code in one or more new cells.
Accept Agent plan

The Agent asks you to Accept & Run each block of code it generates. This keeps a human-in-the-loop. Feel free to review or edit the code and continue through each of the steps until you finish.
Run agent code

Once you are finished, simply close this new notebook tab and return to the original ai-assisted-data-science.ipynb tab to continue with the final section of the lab.
