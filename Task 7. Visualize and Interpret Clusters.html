Task 7. Visualize and Interpret Clusters
With your predictions now loaded into a DataFrame, you can create visualizations to bring the data to life. In this section, you use popular Python libraries like Matplotlib to explore the differences between the housing segments. You create box plots and bar charts to visually compare key features like price and property age, making it easy to build an intuitive understanding of each cluster.
